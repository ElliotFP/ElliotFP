### Salutations, I'm Elliot

I studied honours Math and CS at McGill University, graduating in 2024. My main interests during my degree were probability oriented courses. I'm currently working on simulation software for blasting in mines at [watoga.tech](https://watoga.tech) to improve the mine to mill process, I'm also doing this for my masters' project that I will be starting in 2025. I also enjoy playing chess and doing a lot of sports, currently, I've taken up boxing and I'll be fighting one of my friends at the end of the summer.

TLDR:
- ‚õèÔ∏è Currently working on simulation software for the blast process in mines.
- ü•ä Training for a boxing match.
